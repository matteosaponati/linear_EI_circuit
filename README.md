## dependencies
the code is written in [Python 3.x]
1. [numpy]
2. [matplotlib]

## usage
`git clone` the repository to your home computer.

## structure  
`python linear_ei_main {} {} {}` - insert the values of beta1 and beta2 and the affine transformation matrix A (as a list of 4 elements `[a1,a2,a3,a4]`)

output: the numerical solution of the AR(2) and of the (E,I) system obtained with the affine transformation
